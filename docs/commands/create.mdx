# VKPR Create Formula

## Description

Create a new formula to use in VKPR. 

:::warning Caution!
As VKPR was built on top of Ritchie, it needs Ritchie's dependencies to create the necessary structures to execute the formula. For this you will need to have previously run the `rit init` command.
:::

:::note Attention!
This formula is used only when you want to contribute with VKPR.

## Commands

```bash
