# Most common error using cert-manager

Most errors that occur in cert-manager are usually identified in the objects it creates, namely `Order` and `Challenge`.

## Error with Credentials

You must verify that the credentials used in cert-manager are correct.
Also check that the domain you are referencing to create the `certificate` belongs to the credential account.

```jsx title="➜ kubectl describe challenge whoami-cert-f8qns-2445062599-737753945"
...
Status:
  Reason:        Error presenting challenge: failed to change Route 53 record set: InvalidClientTokenId: The security token included in the request is invalid.duplicate-certificate-limit/
  State:         errored
Events:

  Warning  PresentError  1m (x20 over 1d)  cert-manager  Error presenting challenge: failed to change Route 53 record set: InvalidClientTokenId: The security token included in the request is invalid.
```

### Solving

Get the credential and check the values:

```sh
kubectl get secret vkpr-YOUR_CLOUD-credential -o=jsonpath="{.data.VALUE}" -n vkpr | base64 --decode
```

Check that ClusterIssuer is pointing to the correct Let's Encrypt server and that the credentials are correctly pointing to the credential secret:

```jsx title="➜ kubectl get clusterissuer certmanager-issuer -o=yaml | yq eval ".spec" -"
...
acme:
  email: example@vkpr.com
  preferredChain: ""
  privateKeySecretRef:
    name: letsencrypt-production-key
  server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
  solvers:
    - dns01:
        route53:
          accessKeyIDSecretRef:
            key: access-key
            name: vkpr-aws-credential
          hostedZoneID: ...
          region: us-east-1
          secretAccessKeySecretRef:
            key: secret-key
            name: vkpr-aws-credential
      selector: {}
```

## Too many certificates

Occurs when more than 5 certificate requests are made to the same address, you must wait a week to be requesting new certificates for the address.

```jsx title="➜ kubectl describe order whoami-cert-mnc9g-2445062599"
...
Status:
  Reason:        Failed to create Order: 429 urn:ietf:params:acme:error:rateLimited: Error creating new order :: too many certificates (5) already issued for this exact set of domains in the last 168 hours: whoami.test.vkpr.com, retry after 2022-09-01T04:46:38Z: see https://letsencrypt.org/docs/duplicate-certificate-limit/
  State:         errored
Events:          <none>
```

## Using wrong ClusterIssuer

Check that ClusterIssuer is correctly written using the VKPR production option.

Url's used for issuing the certificates:

- `staging environment`: https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
- `production environment`: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory

```jsx title="➜ kubectl get clusterissuer certmanager-issuer -o=yaml | yq eval ".spec" -"
