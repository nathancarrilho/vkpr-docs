# VKPR Basics

Adopting Kubernetes is a challenging mission for companies of any size - it has a steep learning curve and skilled professionals are very hard to come by. Although managed kubernetes offerings from cloud vendors are a great step in a good direction, it is still hard to find the best way to provision and maintain them.

Once provisioned, it is even harder to go from a barebones cluster to a production-ready one: what tools and settings do I need for monitoring, security, logging or backup? How can I automate their setup in a simple and repeatable way?

## What is VKPR

VKPR was developed to make Kubernetes easier to use. It is composed of:

- A very clean CLI with a simple syntax
- Automations that make your life easier
- Third-party components

All those are organized to deliver a production-ready Kubernetes with minimal effort.

## Developer workflow

VKPR supports convenient workflows for a developer that must rely on kubernetes but wishes to avoid its complexity.

## Deployment workflow
