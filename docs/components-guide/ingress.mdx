# Ingress

In order for users to access the internal applications of a K8S cluster, it is necessary to use Ingress. But for Ingress to work you will need an Ingress-Controller to manage all the load balancing.

VKPR offers two types of Ingress-Controllers:

- [nGINX](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx): Ingress controller for Kubernetes using NGINX as a reverse proxy and load balancer.
- [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/): A modern HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer made to deploy microservices with ease. (Only in local Env)
