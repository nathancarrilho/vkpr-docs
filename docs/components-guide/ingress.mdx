# Ingress

In order for users to access the internal applications of a K8S cluster, it is necessary to use Ingress. But for Ingress to work you will need an Ingress-Controller to manage all the load balancing.

VKPR offers two types of Ingress-Controllers:

- [Consul](https://www.consul.io/docs): Consul is a multi-network tool that solves the network and security challenges of operating microservices and cloud infrastructure. To see Consul commands, click [here](/docs/commands/consul/install)
- [nGINX](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx): Ingress controller for Kubernetes using NGINX as a reverse proxy and load balancer. To see nGINX commands, click [here](/docs/commands/ingress/install)
- [Kong](https://docs.konghq.com/): API gateway built for hybrid and multi-cloud, optimized for microservices and distributed architectures. To see Kong commands, click [here](/docs/commands/kong/install)
- [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/): A modern HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer made to deploy microservices with ease. (Only in local Env) To see Traefik commands, click [here](/docs/commands/infra/start)
