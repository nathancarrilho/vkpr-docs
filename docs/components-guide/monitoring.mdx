# Monitoring and Logging

When scaling and improving applications with the K8S, it is necessary at some point to be verifying that applications are working as expected. By monitoring your applications you can see that your infrastructure is underutilizing resources that could be saved.

VKPR makes the integration of certain monitoring tools available for use in your cluster, being them:

- [Grafana](https://grafana.com/grafana/): Dashboard to visualize all data from yours applications.
- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/): Used to monitor and alert applications.
- [Loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/): Used to monitor applications logs.
